**** ANN ****

Library for neural network potentials for atomistic simulations.
Included is code for neural networks, neural network potentials, and
training neural network potentials.
Data can currently be read from the following formats:
	VASP xml

**** Required Libraries ****

Eigen - (v.3.0.0 or later) - eigen.tuxfamily.org
	Template library for matrix multiplication and linear algebra.
	Header only - no compilation required.
	Include path required in makefile

*** Installation ***

Modify the include directories in the makefile such that the location
of the Eigen library is included.
Execute the command "make" to build the training code.
Execute "make test" to build the testing code.
