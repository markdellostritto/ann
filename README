Example: training a neural network to fit a Tanh function.

Requirements:
-executable: python
-executable: nn_fit_1D.exe

A python executable is required to generate the gaussian data
using the 'write_tanh.py' script.
The executable 'nn_fit_1D.exe' is required to fit the gaussian function.
Default values are assumed for these two exucutables in the 'run.sh' script.
One should change them to appropriate values based on the
current system configuration.
